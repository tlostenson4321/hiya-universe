<h2> Who I am and where I am from</h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Taran Ostenson. I am from Boulder, CO and currently living in Denver.  <br>
I went to college right out of High School in 2008 and was not ready for it. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do as a career and became overwhelmed.
I started working full-time and have been since. I have gone back to school twice since 2008, once for
Early Childhood Education and then again a year later for Web Development. Unfortunately I realised that a normal school setting is not how I learn best. 
I enjoyed the class work but work and supporting myself was my focus and my "job". I have been learning HTML and CSS on my own while working full-time. 
  </p>
  
  <h2> Goals </h2>
<ul>
<li>My immediate goals are to get into a Web Development Bootcamp so I can work on the skills I already have and build on them in a more focused atmosphere.
I really would like to have a job that I can be passionate about. Whether it be designing a page myself or helping someone else make their ideas into a reality.</li><br>
<li> A long term goal that I have for my career, is to become a freelance developer. I don't want this to be immediate because I know that being able to work with others
 is one of the best ways that I can learn. The reason that freelance entices me so much is because I can work on a lot of different projects in many different areas. </li>

<h2> Something That I Work to Live by</h2>
<p> One evening, an elderly
Cherokee Brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people.
 </p>
 <p> He said, "My Son, the battle is between two 'wolves' inside us all.</p>
<p> "One is Evil. It is Anger, Envy, Jealousy, Sorrow, Regret, Greed
 Arrogance, Self-Pity, Guilt, Resentment, Inferiority, Lies, False Pride, Superiority, and Ego.</p>
 <p> "The other is Good. It is Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Serenity, Humility, Kindness, Benevolence, Empathy, Generosity,
 Truth, Compassion, and Faith."</p>
 <p> The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf wins?"</p>
 <p> The old cherokee simply replied, "The one that you feed."</p>
"THE ONE THAT YOU FEED"</p>
